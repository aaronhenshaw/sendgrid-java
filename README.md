Java Library for SendGrid API

-------------

This is a java library for use with the SendGrid web API.  

It performs both Newsletter API functions:

As well as transactional Email functions:

It is by no means full featured yet as it is a work in progress.  As I need functionality for another project I will keep adding to this.

Enjoy!
